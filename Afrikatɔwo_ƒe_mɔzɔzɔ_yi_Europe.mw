Since the 1960s, the main source countries of migration from Africa to Europe have been [[Moroko|Morocco]], [[Ɔldzeria|Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]], resulting in large diasporas with origins in these countries by the end of the 20th century. In the period following the 1973 oil crisis, immigration controls in European states were tightened. The effect of this was not to reduce migration from North Africa but rather to encourage permanent settlement of previously temporary migrants and associated family migration. Much of this migration was from the Maghreb to [[France]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Germany]]. From the second half of the 1980s, the destination countries for migrants from the Maghreb broadened to include [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], as a result of increased demand for low-skilled labour in those countries.
