== ''Annona muricata'' ==
''Annona muricata'' (common Spanish name: guanábana) is a species of the genus ''Annona'' of the custard apple tree family, Annonaceae, which has edible fruit.  The fruit is usually called '''soursop''' due to its slightly acidic taste when ripe.  ''Annona muricata'' is native to the Caribbean and Central America but is now widely cultivated – and in some areas, becoming invasive – in tropical climates throughout the world.

== Description ==
''Annona muricata'' is a small, upright, evergreen tree that can grow to about 4 metres (13{{convert|4|m|ft}} tall.<ref name="UoC">{{cite web|url=http://florawww.eeb.uconn.edu/199900586.html|title=''Annona muricata'' L.|accessdate=2008-04-18|author=EEB Greenhouse Staff, [[University of Connecticut]]|date=2008-04-10|work=Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Greenhouses|publisher=Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Greenhouses|quote=[http://www.crfg.org/descr/descr_main_a12.html crfg]}}</ref><ref name="FoP">{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=3&taxon_id=200008507|title=''Annona muricata'' L.,|accessdate=2008-04-18|publisher=eFloras.org}}</ref>
Its young branches are hairy. Leaves are oblong to oval, 8 centimetres (3.1{{convert|8|cm|in}} to 16 centimetres (6.3{{convert|16|cm|in}} long and 3 centimetres (1.2{{convert|3|cm|in}} to 7 centimetres (2.8{{convert|7|cm|in}} wide.  They are a glossy dark green with no hairs above, and paler and minutely hairy to no hairs below.  The leaf stalks are 4 millimetres (0.16{{convert|4|mm|in}} to 13 millimetres (0.51{{convert|13|mm|in}} long and without hairs.
[[File:Annona_muricata_Blanco1.196.png|thumb|295x295px|Botanical drawing showing flower, leaves, and fruit.]]
Flower stalks (peduncles) are 2 millimetres (0.079{{convert|2|mm|in}} to 5 millimetres (0.20{{convert|5|mm|in}} long and woody. They appear opposite from the leaves or as an extra from near the leaf stalk, each with one or two flowers, occasionally a third.  Stalks for the individual flowers (pedicels) are stout and woody, minutely hairy to hairless and 15 millimetres (0.59{{convert|15|mm|in}} to 20 millimetres (0.79{{convert|20|mm|in}} with small bractlets nearer to the base which are densely hairy.

The petals are thick and yellowish.  Outer petals meet at the edges without overlapping and are broadly ovate, 2.8 centimetres (1.1{{convert|2.8|cm|in}} to 3.3 centimetres (1.3{{convert|3.3|cm|in}} by 2.1 centimetres (0.83{{convert|2.1|cm|in}} to 2.5 centimetres (0.98{{convert|2.5|cm|in}}, tapering to a point with a heart shaped base. They are evenly thick, and are covered with long, slender, soft hairs externally and matted finely with soft hairs within.  Inner petals are oval shaped and overlap. They measure roughly 2.5 centimetres (0.98{{convert|2.5|cm|in}} to 2.8 centimetres (1.1{{convert|2.8|cm|in}} by 2 centimetres (0.79{{convert|2|cm|in}}, and are sharply angled and tapering at the base.  Margins are comparatively thin, with fine matted soft hairs on both sides. The receptacle is conical and hairy. The stamens are 4.5 millimetres (0.18{{convert|4.5|mm|in}} long and narrowly wedge-shaped. The connective-tip terminate abruptly and anther hollows are unequal. Sepals are quite thick and do not overlap. Carpels are linear and basally growing from one base.  The ovaries are covered with dense reddish brown hairs, 1-ovuled, style short and stigma truncate.

The fruits are dark green and prickly.  They are ovoid and can be up to 30 centimetres (12{{convert|30|cm|in}} long, with a moderately firm texture.<ref name="PIER">{{cite web|url=http://www.hear.org/pier/species/annona_muricata.htm|title=Annona muricata L., Annonaceae|accessdate=2008-04-18|date=2008-01-05|publisher=Institute of Pacific Islands Forestry: Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512172421/http://www.hear.org/pier/species/annona_muricata.htm|archivedate=12 May 2008|deadurl=no}}</ref> Their flesh is juicy, acid, whitish and aromatic.

== Distribution ==
''Annona muricata'' is tolerant of poor soil and prefers lowland areas between the altitudes of 0 metres (0{{convert|0|m|ft}} to 1,200 metres (3,900{{convert|1200|m|ft}}.  It cannot stand frost.  The exact origin is unknown; it is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated.

== Cultivation ==
The plant is grown for its 20–30{{convert|20|-|30|cm|abbr=on}} long, prickly, green fruit, which can have a mass of up to 6.8{{convert|15|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}},<ref>http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/morton/soursop.html{{full}}</ref> making it probably the second biggest annona after the junglesop.
[[File:Annona_muricata_1.jpg|left|thumb|Fruit and leaves of ''Annona muricata'']]
Away from its native area, some limited production occurs as far north as southern Florida within USDA Zone 10; however, these are mostly garden plantings for local consumption. It is also grown in parts of Southeast Asia and abundant on the Island of Mauritius.

== Uses ==
The flesh of the fruit consists of an edible, white pulp, some fiber, and a core of indigestible black seeds. The species is the only member of its genus suitable for processing and preservation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The pulp is also used to make fruit nectar, smoothies, fruit juice drinks, as well as candies, sorbets, and ice cream flavorings.

Due to the fruit's widespread cultivation and popularity in parts of Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, Southeast Asia and the Pacific, soursop and its derivative products are consumed across the world, also via branded food and beverage products available in many countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Canada, the United States, the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.

In Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, and Harar (Ethiopia), it is a common fruit, often used for dessert as the only ingredient, or as an ''agua fresca'' beverage; in Colombia and Venezuela, it is a fruit for juices, mixed with milk. In Cuba, a thick smoothie made of soursop pulp, milk and cane sugar goes by the name of ''champola''. Ice cream and fruit bars made of soursop are also very popular. The seeds are normally left in the preparation, and removed while consuming, unless a blender is used for processing.

In [[Indonesia]], ''dodol sirsak'', a sweetmeat, is made by boiling soursop pulp in water and adding sugar until the mixture hardens. Soursop is also a common ingredient for making fresh fruit juices that are sold by street food vendors. In the Philippines, it is called ''guyabano'', derived from the Spanish ''guanábana'', and is eaten ripe, or used to make juices, smoothies, or ice cream. Sometimes, they use the leaf in tenderizing meat. In [[Vietnam]], this fruit is called ''mãng cầu Xiêm'' ([[Thailand|Siamese]] Soursop) in the south, or ''mãng cầu'' (Soursop) in the north, and is used to make smoothies, or eaten as is. In [[Cambodia]], this fruit is called ''tearb barung'', literally "western custard-apple fruit." In Malaysia, it is known in Malay as ''durian belanda'' and in East Malaysia, specifically among the Dusun people of Sabah, it is locally known as ''lampun''. Popularly, it is eaten raw when it ripens, or used as one of the ingredients in ''Ais Kacang'' or ''Ais Batu Campur''. Usually the fruits are taken from the tree when they mature and left to ripen in a dark corner, whereafter they will be eaten when they are fully ripe. It has a white flower with a very pleasing scent, especially in the morning. While for people in Brunei Darussalam this fruit is popularly known as "Durian Salat", widely available and easily planted. It was most likely brought from Mexico to the Philippines by way of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon trade.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

=== Alternative cancer treatment ===
The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center lists cancer treatment as one of the "purported uses" of soursop. According to Cancer Research UK, "Many sites on the internet advertise and promote graviola capsules as a cancer cure, but none of them are supported by any reputable scientific cancer organisations" and "there is no evidence to show that graviola works as a cure for cancer" and consequently they do not support its use as a treatment for cancer.<ref name="canuk">{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/graviola|title=Graviola (soursop)|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]}}</ref>

The Federal Trade Commission in the United States determined that there was "no credible scientific evidence" that the extract of soursop sold by Bioque Technologies "can prevent, cure, or treat cancer of any kind."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2008/09/boguscures.shtm|title=FTC Sweep Stops Peddlers of Bogus Cancer Cures|date=18 September 2008|publisher=FTC}}</ref>

Cancer Research UK<ref>http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/graviola{{full}}</ref> also released a statement about the alleged cancer "cure" that included these sentences:
"Overall, there is no evidence to show that graviola works as a cure for cancer. In laboratory studies, graviola extracts can kill some types of liver and breast cancer cells that are resistant to particular chemotherapy drugs. But there haven’t been any large scale studies in humans. So we don't know yet whether it can work as a cancer treatment or not. Many sites on the internet advertise and promote graviola capsules as a cancer cure, but none of them are supported by any reputable scientific cancer organisations. We do not support the use of graviola to treat cancer."

In 2008, a court case relating to the sale in the UK of Triamazon, a soursop product, resulted in the criminal conviction of a man under the terms of the UK Cancer Act for offering to treat people for cancer. A spokesman for the council that instigated the action stated, "it is as important now as it ever was that people are protected from those peddling unproven products with spurious claims as to their effects."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=10 September 2008|title=Man convicted over cancer 'cure'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7608256.stm}}</ref>
